# 07 Team VBV's Project 1 - P1

## Superhero Showdown

**A quick description**: Welcome to Team VBV's first fully functional product; Superhero Showdown. 
Do you like superheroes? Duh! Do you like supervillains? Maybe. What about having Harry Potter fight Lex Luthor? Sure, why not?
On the Superhero Matchup page, you'll choose two characters to pit in the *ULTIMATE* death battle, just to see who would win via arbitrary statistics.

We've utilized two APIs to make this magic happen: Superhero API and Image-Charts. The Superhero API is where we pull data on over 700 fictional characters for your pure amusement, while the Image-Charts API provides us a way to convey that information meaningfully.

You can easily find our page: [Deployed Here](https://victormoscone.github.io/vbv_project1)

**To use**:
1. Click on the drop-down boxes to find two fighters that you'd like to go head-to-head!
2. Once both fighters are selected, click on FIGHT!
3. View your results!

## Reflection

For the most part, we overcame all of the challenges that we were faced with and leave with fairly little regrets. We do wish to better understand how to organize pull-requests better in the future, as we had a lot of headaches with it.

If we were given more time to improve the app we would:
1. Add a Pie Chart on the fight page that displays the total values of both fighters.
2. Add a Recent Fights feed on the matchup page.
3. Add an About and Contact page.
4. Add the character's image behind the card on the fight page.
5. Refactor some of the Fight Script to be more concise and clean. 

## Setup Instruction
